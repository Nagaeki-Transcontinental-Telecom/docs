## Via Internet eXchange

When peering with AS199683 via an Internet eXchange, it is common practice to establish a session with the route server, accept peer routes, and send our routes following the open peering policy. Additionally, it is possible to set up a private peering session with us.

If you wish to establish private sessions, please email our NOC at [noc@nttele.com](noc@nttele.com).

## Via Tunnels

We support WireGuard, GRE and GRETAP tunnels if no direct connections are available.

If you wish to peer via Layer 2/3 tunnels, please email our NOC at [noc@nttele.com](noc@nttele.com).
